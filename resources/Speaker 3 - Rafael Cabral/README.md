Bookdown: [Fitting robust non-Gaussian models in Stan](rafaelcabral96.github.io)

Bio: My name is Rafael and I am PhD candidate at KAUST, Saudi Arabia, being supervised by Profs. Haavard Rue, and David Bolin. My PhD research revolves around building more flexible, robust, and computationally efficient modeling frameworks for spatial and temporal data. Iâ€™ve worked with Gaussian and non-Gaussian processes, model criticism and robustness, and approximate inference with Stan, INLA, and variational inference.
